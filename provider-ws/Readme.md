# Modes

This transport has two modes: Simple and JAX-WS. If the service is annotated using @Webservice
then JAX-WS mode is used else simple mode is used.

## Simple

This mode uses the CXF simple frontend and the Aegis Databinding. It can export almost any service but is not much configurable. Aegis is also not very popular anymore. So this
mode for exporting existing services and small tests. For most cases the JAX-WS mode is recommended.

## JAX-WS

If the service is annotated using @Webservice then the JAX-WS mode is activated. It uses
the CXF JAX-WS frontend and the JAXB databinding. It can be customized using the usual annotations.
